    steps:

      # Download and cache dependencies
      # Note the Docker image must still be manually updated if any binary (non-Python) dependencies change.

      # Restore cache if it exists. setup.py defines all the requirements, so we checksum that.
      # If you want to force an update despite setup.py not changing, you can bump the version
      # number `vn-dependencies`. This can be useful if newer versions of a package have been
      # released that you want to upgrade to, without mandating the newer version in setup.py.

      # Install seals.
      # Note we install the source distribution, not in developer mode (`pip install -e`).
      # This ensures we're testing the package our users would experience, and in particular

# Workflows specify what jobs to actually run on CircleCI. If we didn't specify this,
# nothing would run! Here we have just a single workflow, `test`, containing both the
# jobs defined above. By default, the jobs all run in parallel. We can make them run
# sequentially, or have more complex dependency structures, using the `require` command;
# see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/
#
# We attach two contexts to both jobs, which define a set of environment variable:
# - `MuJoCo` which contains the URL for our MuJoCo license key.
# - `docker-hub-creds` which contain the credentials for our Dockerhub machine user.
# It's important these are kept confidential -- so don't echo the environment variables
# anywhere in the config!
